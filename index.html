        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, My name is Cristiane Sell dos Santos de Moraes" width="200">
        <p>My name is Cristiane, and I live in the beautiful city of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. I’m passionate about reading, playing volleyball, hiking in nature, and watching movies. I also love spending sunny days at the beach with my family. I’ve been happily married for seven years, and we have a wonderful daughter who brings so much joy to our lives. In my free time, I enjoy cooking new recipes, exploring local cafes, and taking family trips to discover new places. Family time is very important to me, and I cherish every moment we spend together creating memories.</p>

        <p>Brazil, the largest country in South America, is known for its diverse culture, vibrant festivals, and natural wonders. It is home to the Amazon Rainforest, one of the most biodiverse places on Earth, and famous landmarks like Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's population is a blend of Indigenous, European, African, and Asian influences, reflected in its rich traditions, music, and cuisine. Portuguese is the official language, and the country is renowned for its passion for football (soccer), having won the FIFA World Cup five times. With sprawling cities like São Paulo and Rio alongside breathtaking landscapes, Brazil offers a unique blend of urban and natural beauty.</p>
